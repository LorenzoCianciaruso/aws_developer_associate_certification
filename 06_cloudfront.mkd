#Â 06. Cloudfront

It caches content that can live in multiple origin. Usually S3 is one of the most popular.
Edges are the datacenter where cloudfront live. They are external to the general AWS region. This is because
a client can request a resource from S3 and the closest edge will be able to distribute the requested resource faster than  going to the closest regions. There are more edges than regions.

In case the cache is missed, than the request will be forwarder to the region to get the resoruce.

It can be a distribution of WEB resource (hence s3) or a distribution of dynamic resources like streaming flows.

It can be monitored and you can set up alerts, there is a proper console in aws showing dashboards, hit/miss, resource being cached,
client devices calling, etc.

## Best practices for Static Content
* use S3
* allow access on S3 only from cloudfront
* control access content on cloudfront
* high TTL
* Versioning

## Best practises for Dynamic Content
* use TTL even if it is only for a few seconds (depends on the business case)
* using multiple caching behaviours

## Best practises for Streaming
* TTLS: LOW TTL for manifest file and HIGH TTL for Media Files and Player
* Use http based stram protocol
* Design for failure: use Route 53 to perform healthchecks and take necessary actions. Use Cloudwatch for alarm and notifications.

## Best practises for Security
* enble end to end HTTPS -> Which means enable Viewer Protocol Policy (which allows HTTPS from the client side), and Origin Protocol Policy (which allows for HTTPS when retrieving resources from the origin)
